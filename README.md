# agent-code-interpreter
This repository showcases an intelligent agent built using LangChain and Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o model. The agent is designed to interpret natural language instructions, generate Python code, and execute it in real-time using a Python REPL tool. It leverages the qrcode library to perform tasks like generating QR codes dynamically based on user input.
